== Introduction

Have you ever had trouble keeping track of your tutorials and students as a TA in NUS? TAble is your handy desktop app, optimized for TAs who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! Mark attendance, arrange consults, add module notes, and more with TAble!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TAble.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TAble.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listStudent`* : lists all students
* **`addStudent`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : adds a student named `John Doe` to TAble.
* **`deleteStudent`**`3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
