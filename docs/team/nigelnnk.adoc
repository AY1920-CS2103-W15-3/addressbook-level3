== PROJECT: TAble

== Overview

TAble is your handy desktop app, optimized for TAs who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! Mark attendance, arrange consults, add module notes, and more with TAble! It has a GUI created with JavaFX and written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *insert Module description/links/time*
** What it does: Represents module information critical to a Teaching Assistant's role in their work, from notes of the module to handling module links.
** Justification: Teaching Assistants need to view general module information and associate Tutorials with modules. This helps consolidate general information about the module (through its notes and module links).
** Highlights: Module links can be stored in TAble and shared easily with the command to copy links into the user's clipboard. Additionally, note of the module can also be updated to store important information like grade breakdown.
